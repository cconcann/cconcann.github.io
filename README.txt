There is no required compilation, simply run the code.
all thats required is a text file that has a grid of digits in a text file with spaces in between each digit
on lines 320 and 321 input the location of the desired start and end points in the grid (ensure that they actually exist)
then on line 342 put the path name to the text document you wish to run the algo on
the result will be saved to a text file called path.
